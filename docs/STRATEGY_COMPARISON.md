## Combined Strategy Option? 🤔

**Could you run BOTH strategies simultaneously?**

### Pros:
- Diversification across timeframes (1m + 15m)
- Diversification across logic (news + trend)
- More total trades (~16/month combined)
- Spread risk across two approaches

### Cons:
- More complex to manage
- Potential signal overlap/conflicts
- Need to track two separate systems
- 2x the monitoring effort

### Recommendation:
**Start with news filter only** for these reasons:
1. Superior performance on recent data (3.5x better)
2. Lower risk profile
3. Easier to manage (one system)
4. Can always add uptrend later if needed
